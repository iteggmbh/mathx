  <h2>URLs for individual Curves</h2>
  <ul>
	<li><tt>ecc.html#a=1&amp;b=-1</tt> <a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-shortw.html">Weierstrass Curve</a>
	  used by the standardized
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA Signature Scheme</a>.
	  The parameters <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> may be chosen in a range from <tt>-1</tt> to <tt>1</tt>,
	  <i>a</i> is most often shosen as <tt>-1</tt>, while the most prominent choices for <i>b</i>
	  are <tt>0</tt>, <tt>0.3</tt>, <tt>0.4</tt> or <tt>1</tt>.
	</li>
	<li><tt>ecc.html#d=10</tt> <a href="http://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-edwards.html">Edwards Curve</a>
	  used by the <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/papers.html">Ed25519 Signature Scheme</a>. The parameter
	  <i>d</i> may be chosen in a wide range from <tt>-100</tt> to <tt>100</tt>. The additional
	  parameter <i>c</i> mentioned by the references is chosen to be one.</li>	
  </ul>
  Examples: <a href="#a=-1&b=0">#a=-1&amp;b=0</a>, <a href="#a=-1&b=1">#a=-1&amp;b=1</a>,
            <a href="#d=10">#d=10</a> or <a href="#d=-10">#d=-10</a>.
  <h2>Interactive Usage</h2>
  <ul>
	<li><tt>Ctrl-Click</tt> or <i>long touch (0.5-1s)</i> selects the first point <i>p</i> of the addition,
		  a second selection selects the second point <i>q</i> and you will earn the resulting point
		  <i>p+q</i> as a third point.</li>
	<li><tt>Ctrl-Shift-Click</tt> or <i>extra long touch (&gt;1s)</i> selects one point <i>p</i> for doubling
		  and you will earn the resulting point
		  <i>2&middot;p</i> as a third point.</li>
  </ul>
  For the Weierstrass case you will also see the defining plane aka the line in the projective space
  intersecting the curve at the mirrored point of <i>p+q</i>.
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Around Christmas 2015 I played around with 3D visualizations together with my son and
	stepped over the three.js library, which suddenly trapped my attention as a mathematician
	and long-time developer in computer graphics.</p>
  <p>On the other side, I'm also involved in consulting large customers on cryptography topics,
	so I soon decided to visualize the group operation used by Elliptic Curve Craptography schemes
	in the Projective Space represented by the semi-shpere you see on teh canvas.</p>
  <p>A numerical integrator and an implementation of Cardano's formula later I was able to draw
	the classical Weierstrass Elliptic Curves, which constitute the standard ECDSA
	algorithm together with the group peration defined on it.</p>
  <p>Being advised by Robert Penz, a fellow seucrity specialist in our area, I suddenly started
	implementing Edwards Curves, which have a much simpler group operation as you can prove by
	reading the code in ecc.js
